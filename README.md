# Introduction
The FNF-NovaFlare-Engine was originally created to be compatible with the Camellia mod, and it has continuously evolved into an independent engine, developed by Chinese developers. 
This fork is for personal use, which aims at adding a score display on the 2nd screen of AYN Thor (or maybe other dual screen andriod console).

V1.0.1 is based on FNF-Psych-Engine-0.6.3.
V1.1.0-beta-1 and above are based on 0.7.3.
V1.1.8-HOTFIX is based on 0.7.3 and supports mods version 1.0.0 and above (partially).
v1.2.1: Minimum support **Psych mod 0.7.3 to 1.0.4**, **V-Slice 0.8.4**, **CodeName 1.0.1**

Highly optimize a large number of pending issues, including but not limited to frame rate improvement, loading optimization, major overhauls of the underlying system, and script system overhauls...  
Add more practical features and beautify the interface.  

~~Make your device stronger, more awesome, more invincible, more frequent, more ridiculous, more despair-inducing, and more frustratingly prone to crashes.~~

# Function
## Hscript Upgrade

Starting from NovaFlare 1.2.0, Hscript has been upgraded to Hscript--iris-improved. This update brings script syntax closer to actual source code, with support for `class` and `package`.

## Performance Improvements

- The first TPS frame count has exceeded 1000.
- Thread separation for rendering has been implemented for the first time.
- Immix GC optimization reduces lag during gameplay.

## Interface and Underlying Updates

- The freeplay option interface has been rewritten for a better visual experience.
- The underlying Haxelib has been fully upgraded, with added recording and replay features.

## Miscellaneous

- ~~All of NF's developers are Chinese (though this is not particularly relevant).~~

**You'll need to explore more features on your own.**

# Notes!!!!
## Open Source Usage

We welcome everyone to use our open-source code, **but please make sure to give proper credit to the original source.** Our open-source code is for reference, not for plagiarism. Of course, you can copy **small amounts** of it, but please cite the original source. Copy too much, and you might even confuse players between your engine and the NF engine. Just wait, buddy, we’ll come after you.

## About the "private" Directory

The `private` directory in this repository is used for integrating NovaFlare with [GameAnalytics](https://www.gameanalytics.com) to collect usage data from our staff. It is not made public because it contains sensitive API keys, and we require real data for internal purposes.

[You can use now](https://github.com/NovaFlare-Engine-Concentration/Gameanalytics-haxe/tree/main)
